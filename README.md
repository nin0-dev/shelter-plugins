# nin0dev's shelter plugins

Hello. I am nin0dev. I make terrible code for no living. Here are my painful to use Shelter plugins.

Unlike the average DevilBro plugin, this code actually works without lagging your entire Discord instance.

Get shelter at https://github.com/uwu/shelter

## In dev plugins 
- CommandAPI: Adds APIs for other plugins to use to make prefix based commands

## Discontinued plugins
- Avast: Adds (fake) Avast Antivirus Free support to Shelter. Your messages will all be secured by Avast. (they won't, this isn't an AV. use your common sense)
